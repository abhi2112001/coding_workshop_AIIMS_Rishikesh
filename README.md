In the workshop for 12/09/22 we made a Telegram Book Bot, which takes data from libgen and sends the details of the book alongwith link to download it to the user on Telegram

How we made Telegram Bot- 
			1. We imported a module named "PyTelegramBotAPI==3.6.7" using "pip install PyTelegramBotAPI==3.6.7".
			2. We then imported another module named "libgen", which will provide us with details of the book.
			3. We then initiated the bot using the documentation provided for PyTelegramBotAPI and got our desired books for the search.
